# DurstBot
Incredibly cursed Discord Bot for the UoB AMPS Server.

## Description
We partake in a moderate amount of tomfoolery.

## Prerequisites
python = "^3.8"
flask = "^2.0.1"
discord.py = "^1.7.3"
PyNaCl = "^1.4.0"

## Getting Started
DurstBot runs off a Replit server, and connects to discord via the developer API.
It's 3 functions are located in [gears.py](gears.py) and it is a mess :))
You can create your own extension in a new script, just make sure any functions are `discord.ext.commands.Cog` objects.
